Planning diagram: 

I plan on creating two main sections of the page: 

App.jsx -> Home -> `/`

Profile.jsx -> Profile -> `/profile/${customerId}`

I felt it was easier for me to understand it with this structure. 

Component tree: 

App.jsx
 - Profile.jsx
 - Posts.jsx
   - Post.jsx
     - CreateComment.jsx
     - CreatePost.jsx
 - DisplayPost.jsx
 
App.css for all styling.
